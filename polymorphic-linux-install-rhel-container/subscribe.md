Polymorphic Linux is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all of the existing packages in your container. To use, simply point your package repository to the Polyverse repositories instead of a community run “mirror”. From then on, Polymorphic Linux operates identically to standard Linux.


We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors, found on the
[free trial page](https://polyverse.io/polymorphic-linux-installation-guide/).
