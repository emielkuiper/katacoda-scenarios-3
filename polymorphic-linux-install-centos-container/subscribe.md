Polymorphing is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all the existing packages on an existing Linux
host, by pulling them from a Polyverse "mirror".

We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors:

`curl https://sh.polyverse.io | sh -s install tR3pfxuoH2psdW23ZVTJzRgvF webdemo@polyverse.io`{{execute}}
