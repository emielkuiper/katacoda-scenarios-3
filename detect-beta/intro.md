This guide demonstrates how we can use Polyverse’s no click security solution for Linux to detect intrusions. The tutorial will walk through the exploitation of a non-Polyversed instance using a buffer overflow and the detection of the same exploit on a Polyversed instance.

In four simple steps learn how Polyverse’s Polymorphic Linux solution, defends and deters threats. What’s more, see how these attacks are logged and sent to the SIEM of your choice, giving you unprecedented visibility into zero-day cyberattacks.
