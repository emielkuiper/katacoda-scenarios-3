Now let's try the same exploit on the polymorphic Nginx and see what happens...

`exploit`{{execute}}

Not only did the exploit fail to run but it was logged on the dashboard below: 

[Dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)

Try running the exploit a couple more times and see the detection in action.
