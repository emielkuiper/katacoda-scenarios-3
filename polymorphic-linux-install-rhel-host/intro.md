This guide demonstrates a production installation of Polymorphic Linux on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

We will walk through the two steps to Polymorphic Linux installation:
* Subscribing to Polyverse repositories
* Reinstallation of packages

Finally we will verify Polymorphic Linux in a variety of ways.

This being a complete host reinstall, the reinstall step might take
the better part of an hour to complete. But it is entirely automatic and
unsupervised.

To get a quicker example, check out one of the tutorials on
reinstalling in a container instead.
