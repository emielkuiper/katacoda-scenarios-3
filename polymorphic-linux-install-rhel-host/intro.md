This guide demonstrates a production installation of Polymorphic Linux on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

We will walk through the two simple steps to Polymorphic Linux installation:
* Subscribing to Polyverse repositories
* Reinstallation of packages

Finally, we will verify Polymorphic Linux in a variety of ways.

*Note: This is a complete host reinstall. The reinstall step might take
the better part of an hour to complete however, it is entirely automatic and
unsupervised.*

If you want a quicker example, check out one of our other tutorials that
reinstall in a container instead.
