Our hack injected a file called hack.php at a well-known location
which should be available at the URL: [wordpresshost:/hack.php](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/hack.php?arg=1%3B+system%28%27id%27%29)

If you had a syntax error, it just might be the best syntax
error you've ever had! Not only did you successfully stop a previously
unknown, unseen code injection attack, but you also detected it!
