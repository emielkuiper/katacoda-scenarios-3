This guide demonstrates a production installation of Polymorphing for Linux on Ubuntu.

We will walk through the two steps to install Polymorphing:
* Subscribing to Polyverse repositories
* Reinstallation of packages

Finally we will verify Polymorphing in a variety of ways.

This being a complete host reinstall, the reinstall step might take
the better part of an hour to complete. But it is entirely automatic and
unsupervised.

To get a quicker example, check out one of the tutorials on
reinstalling in a container instead.
