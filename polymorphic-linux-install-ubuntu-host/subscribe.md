Polymorphic Linux is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all the existing packages on an existing Linux
host, by pulling them from a Polyverse "mirror".

We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors, found on the
[free trial page](https://polyverse.io/polymorphic-linux-installation-guide/).
